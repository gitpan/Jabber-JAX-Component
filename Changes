       - Added in the Jabber::JAX::Client module for writing high speed clients
       - removed the need Jabber::JAX::MyRouterConnection - this will speed up compile time ( one less module ), and reduce the size of the distribution.
       - added a method to Jabber::JAX::Component called stop, so that the component can gracefully shut itself down

       - upgraded the component to the new version of JECL using the ComponentLoader class
       - added two callbacks inithandler and stophandler for on component connection and 
          when shutting down, respectively
       - created a comprehensive example for a publish & subscribe component that requires
          MySQL as the database ( includes setup script etc. )
